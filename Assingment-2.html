    <h1>Assingment 2: Basic HTML Display Features</h1><br>
    <p>Here is an example of horizontal rule:
        <hr>
    <h2>header size</h2>
<p>and 10<sup>2</sup>=100 points set on the screen. The CO<sub>2</sub>can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.
    <p> We can also change the appearence of words on the screen. This shows some diffrent word types in a blocked quote.</p>
        <p><blockquote>Now in the <i>time</i> for all good <strong>people</strong> to <strong>come</strong> to the <i>aid</i> of their country</blockquote></p>
        <p>That was also an example of a nested command.
